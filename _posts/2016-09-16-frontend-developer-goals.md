title: My goal as Frontend Developer
---
When it comes to front-end development, there is no shortage of those invested in seeing the final outcome be as close to perfect as possible. The primary end result of any web page, application or program needs to keep not just the user in mind but also the team that was involved at every stage of execution.  Below are my key goals when it comes to front-end, all of which I believe are necessary for achieving a great and functional final product. 

### Translating Design into Code

It’s not enough to simply take a designer’s approved mockup and give it functionality. No matter the device or browser in play, the designs must ultimately look almost exactly how the designer initially created them.  

### A Bug-Free Execution 

Testing, testing, testing—no matter how great that initial code is, it is always vital to have a quality assurance state of mind when going through the final product. Breaks, widows, incorrect design/copy elements are all things to lookout for. Ensuring that the product is error free when rendering across devices and browsers is always a key goal. 

### Provide a Friendly User Experience 

How a user experiences the final product will either make it or break it. Giving users a friendly, easy to use interface with clean and simple navigation is always a priority. No matter how great the interface looks, if it doesn’t cater to the needs of the user, makes navigating more difficult than it ought to be, then the developer’s job is not yet done. 

### Ready to Pass it On 

In the end, the code must not only be user friendly but also developer friendly. When working within a team environment, maintaining good project flow and focusing on tasks specific to my skillset, it pays to develop code that can easily be picked up by other developers. Not only is it beneficial to the team and project, but also for the company, helping to keep their talent focused on moving forward effectively and efficiently. 

### Always Keep Improving

Code must be adaptable into today’s always-changing environment. Innovation is a must and should always be at the forefront before taking on any project. Crafting new experiences is a priority when it comes to staying relevant, engaging and successful. 

### Stay Up to Date 

Today’s tech savvy user will always appreciate an interface that is keeping with the times. There are always problems that need to be solved and new techniques mastered. It is important to continue to learn and broaden your skillset every step of the way.
