title: Biggest Chalanges for developer
---

My biggest chalange was not to break keyboard. When i just started and my first simple "Hello World!"  program didn't compile for a 3 hours the keyboard was thrown out of the window. But it teach me i great lesson. Small thing can cause big problem. It was simple **comma** missing. Comma, Carl!.

Be Patient. Keep working never give up, listen to advises, ask for help if need. Thes is biggest challange to understand it and use it through hole career.
